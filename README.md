This is a lazily coded tool. 

I just use this for quick news-reading, systems monitoring and network monitoring.

You can use it but you are not allowed to judge the coding quality :) it's a patchwork and I love it that way.

You can simply install it with `pip install .` and use it as a command line tool: `mytools`
